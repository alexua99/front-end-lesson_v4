            We are all trying to adapt to a new reality post-2020. And for the majority of us, the stock market may
            offer new financial opportunities or even a second income. In the past few months alone, trading volumes
            have gone up the roof, almost double 2020 rates already. As a result, several popular trading platforms have
            been experiencing a boom in new users looking for passive income.
